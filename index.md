               subtitle: "Our community and religious leaders also recognise the hard work and bravery of our frontline workers to save lives. We are leading multi-racial and multi-religious initiatives to support our frontline workers as well as more vulnerable groups in this fight against COVID-19. We will continue to work closely with our communities to keep Singapore and our people safe. To protect everyoneâ€™s well-being, we urge our congregants to work with their religious leaders in implementing the precautionary measures advised by MOH and MCCY. By supporting each other in these challenging times and exercising social responsibility, we can overcome COVID-19, and emerge even stronger and more resilient." Minister Grace Gu, Statement in support of staying united against COVID-19, 25 March 2020
