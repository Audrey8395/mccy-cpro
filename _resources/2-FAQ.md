### Frequently Asked Questions 

### Phase Two

**1. My family members and I live in separate households. Can I pray with them at the place of worship?**
  * Yes. A group of up to 5 worshippers can pray together.
  * Groups of worshippers must be 1 metre apart, and there must be no mixing between groups.

**2. Can I pray with my friends at the place of worship? Must we have a distance of 1 metre between us?**
  * Yes. A group of up to 5 worshippers can pray together.
  * Children twelve years and below, as well as persons who have health conditions that may result in breathing or other medical difficulties when a mask is worn for a prolonged period of time, may wear a face shield in lieu of a face mask.
  
**3. Must I wear a mask at the place of worship, even while praying?**
  * Yes, everyone entering places of worship must wear their masks at all times.
  * Groups of worshippers must be 1 metre apart, and there must be no mixing between groups. Individuals within a group do not need to be 1 metre apart from each other. Refer to Ministry of Health's [Guidance for Use of Masks and Face Shields](https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/guidance-for-use-of-masks-and-face-shields).
  
**4. What is the maximum number of worshippers I can have at my place of worship at any one time?**
  * All permitted religious activities can take place concurrently at the place of worship, as long as these are conducted safely at separate locations within the place of worship. 
  * There can be a maximum of 50 persons in the premises taking part in various religious activities (excluding congregational and other worship services). This limit excludes the religious and essential workers. 
  * For congregational and other worship services, there can be a maximum of 50 worshippers (excluding the religious and supporting workers) at any one time.
  * For example: If a worship service with 50 persons is taking place at the same time as religious classes involving 2 groups of 5 students, there can be no more than 40 persons involved in other religious activities in the place of worship at the same time.
  * There must be sufficient signs and directions to guide the different parties such that they do not interact or meet each other when entering, exiting, or while in the premises. ROs must establish a one-way flow for entry and exit points and manage the arrival of worshippers to avoid queues from forming. 

**5. Is the number of visitors to the columbaria in my temple included in my premise capacity limit?**
  *	Yes. There can be a maximum of 50 persons in the premises taking part in various religious activities (excluding congregational and other worship services). This limit excludes the religious and essential workers. 

**6. Can I have multiple worship services (e.g. different language services) at the same time? How many persons are allowed at each service?**
  * Yes, multiple services are allowed if they can be conducted safely at separate locations within the place of worship, with adequate signs and directions to guide the different congregations such that they do not interact or meet each other while entering, exiting or while in the premises. 
  * ROs must work within the total cap of 50 persons for these worship services. _For example: if there are two concurrent worship services, each can be allocated a limit of 25 persons._
  
**7. My premises are very large with multiple prayer halls. Can I have multiples of 50 persons for worship services?**
  * No. The limit of 50 persons for worship services applies to all places of worship, regardless of the premise size. This is a starting point to manage the risks of resuming worship services and to allow the places of worship to implement their safe management measures.
  * We hope to gradually raise the congregation limit beyond 50 persons, if COVID-19 community transmission remains low and stable, and places of worship are able to implement the safe management measures.  

**8. When will there be an increase in worship services from 50 to 200 persons?**
  * MCCY hopes to gradually raise the congregation limit beyond 50 persons, if COVID-19 community transmission remains low and stable, and places of worship are able to implement the safe management measures.  
  * For now, the maximum number of worshippers allowed for worship services is 50.

**9. Can I have more than one group of 5 in a religious class, in the same room?**
  * Yes. Where necessary, there can be multiple groups of 5, so long as each group is separated by at least 1 metre with no mingling across groups.  
  * As a best practice, we encourage a greater separation of 2 metres between groups of students attending religious classes.
  * ROs must keep within the premise limit of 50 persons for religious classes and other non-congregational religious activities.

**10. How many religious workers, staff and volunteers are we allowed to deploy on-site for worship services? Will this count towards the cap of 50 persons for worship services?**
  * Places of worship may deploy the required manpower to facilitate worship services and other permitted religious activities. The manpower must be limited to essential tasks, kept to a minimum number and adhere to safe management measures. 
  * The cap of 50 persons for worship services excludes the manpower deployed for this purpose.
  * Places of worship can refer to MCCY’s [volunteer management guide for best practices for managing volunteers](https://www.mccy.gov.sg/about-us/news-and-resources/press-statements/2020/jun/Guidelines-for-volunteer-management-during-covid19-pandemic-2).

**11. How do we regulate worshipper / devotee flow on-site?**
  * Religious organisations can consider various best practices such as only allowing worshippers to enter the place of worship by appointment or use a booking system for the worship service. 
  
**12. Can I conduct religious rites (e.g. baptism, communion, medium prayers, receive holy ash) that involve physical contact with worshippers?**
  * As this rite involves physical contact, it will be a deviation from the parameters in MCCY’s 18 June advisory on resumption of more religious activities in Phase Two. 
  * For such deviation cases, you have to first submit a safe management plan that explains how this religious rite can be conducted safely and then wait for MCCY’s approval before commencing the rite.  

**13. Can I open the ancestral hall at my temple to visitors?**
  * Yes. Similar to visitors to columbaria in places of worship, visitors to the ancestral hall should maintain a safe distancing of at least 1 metre between individuals at all times. 
  * Families who visit in groups are limited to no more than 5 persons in a group, with safe distancing of at least 1 metre between groups. These visits should be kept as short as possible, with no mingling between groups

**14. Can a religious worker make house visits to conduct prayers?**
  * House visits by religious workers are not encouraged. 
  * Religious workers who need to make a house visit should abide by the prevailing restrictions on homes, where visits are limited to 5 visitors at a time. 
  * The prayers should be kept to a minimum duration. The religious worker and those present in the home should comply with safe distancing and other safe management measures.

**15. Can I provide food to my devotees as part of worship services?**
  * No. Food should not be served to worshippers before, during or after each worship service. 
  * Services should be kept short as possible, with no mingling of worshippers. Worshippers should also leave the premises immediately after performing their worship. 
  
**16. Do religious organisations (ROs) still need to apply to the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) for a Time-Limited Exemption (TLE) prior to returning on-site to complete administrative tasks?**
  * No, ROs no longer have to apply for a TLE. 
  * In Phase Two, ROs can resume their workplace activities at their registered premises. 
  * Telecommuting must remain the default where feasible, so as to minimise the number of on-site religious workers and staff. 
  * There should be no cross-deployment or interaction between workers in different shifts, teams or worksites, even outside of work. _If cross-deployment cannot be avoided (e.g. due to the nature of the job), additional safeguards must be taken to minimise the risk of cross-infection (e.g. systems are in place to ensure no direct contact with the cross-deployed personnel)._
  * Religious workers and staff on-site must comply with safe distancing and other prevailing [workplace safe management measures stipulated by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM)](https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/requirements-for-safe-management-measures).  

**17. I have submitted Safe Management Plans for my religious organisation (RO) during Phase One. Do I need to submit another plan for Phase Two?**
  * Yes. As Phase Two involves the gradual resumption of congregational and worship services, as well as other non-congregational worship activities, all ROs are required to submit their Safe Management Plan, including manpower deployment, at least 3 days before resumption of Phase Two activities. 
  * ROs who have already submitted their safe management plan in Phase One only need to submit a shorter plan to cover the additional safe management measures for Phase Two activities. Please refer to www.cpro.gov.sg for details. 
  * ROs requesting deviations from the parameters set out in MCCY’s 18 Jun 2020 advisory on resumption of more religious activities in Phase Two will require MCCY’s approval before proceeding with their activities. 
  * MCCY will conduct enforcement checks and action will be taken against ROs who do not comply with the relevant guidelines, including the cessation of operations. 
  
**18. My religious organisation (RO) was not open during Phase One and I did not submit my Phase One Safe Management Plans. Am I allowed to proceed with Phase Two activities?**
  * Your RO has to submit a Safe Management Plan, including manpower deployment, at least 3 days before commencing Phase Two activities. 
  * ROs who wish to deviate from the parameters set out in MCCY’s 18 Jun 2020 advisory on resumption of more religious activities in Phase Two will require MCCY’s approval before proceeding with their activities. 
  * MCCY will conduct enforcement checks and action will be taken against ROs who do not comply with the relevant guidelines, including the cessation of operations.
