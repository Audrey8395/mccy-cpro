#### Religious Organisations

**1. How many religious workers and staff are we allowed to deploy on-site?**
  * Places of worship may deploy religious workers and staff to facilitate private worship and other permitted activities (i.e. marriage solemnizations, funeral-related activities and recording/broadcast sessions), but this group must be limited to essential tasks and kept to a minimum number. 
  * Religious organisations must include their manpower deployment in the [Safe Management Plan](/resources/Resumption-of-Religious-Activities/) that they submit to MCCY within two weeks of re-opening their place of worship and commencing the permitted activities.
  * In addition to MCCY’s advisory, religious organisations must comply with prevailing safe management measures at the workplace stipulated by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) and the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI). 

**2. How do we ensure that there are no queues at places of worship?**
  * Religious organisations can consider implementing an online appointment system to regulate flow of worshippers on-site. 
  * Beyond this, places of worship must put in place [safe management measures](/resources/Resumption-of-Religious-Activities/) to protect worshippers, religious workers and staff. 
  * These include: designating prayer areas; no sharing of prayer items; safe distancing among worshippers, religious workers and staff; sanitising the prayer area after each use; and one-way flow for entry and exit points.   
  * Religious organisations should deploy staff to manage worshipper/devotee flow on-site. 

**3. Do religious organisations still need to apply to the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) for a Time-Limited Exemption (TLE) prior to returning on-site to complete urgent administrative tasks that cannot be done remotely?**
  * Yes, a TLE is required if religious workers or staff need to return to the religious organisation’s premises or place of worship to complete urgent administrative tasks that cannot be done remotely.
  * You can apply to MTI for a TLE via [https://covid.gobusiness.gov.sg](https://covid.gobusiness.gov.sg) one day prior to the conduct of such activities. Religious organisations are not required to inform MCCY of these TLE applications. 
  * These TLEs will be capped at twice per week for each religious organisation (by unique entity number).
  * If additional TLEs are required, religious organisations can appeal to MCCY via [cpro@mccy.gov.sg](mailto:cpro@mccy.gov.sg) and these will be considered on a case-by-case basis. 
  *	For more information on the TLE, please visit [https://covid.gobusiness.gov.sg](https://covid.gobusiness.gov.sg)
  * All religious workers and staff not involved in the permitted on-site activities must telecommute as the default arrangement.
  
**4. My religious organisation needs more time to develop our safe management plans. Can we still re-open on 2 June 2020 while we prepare concurrently?**
  * No. All religious organisations must implement safe management measures **before** re-opening their places of worship for permitted activities in Phase One. This is critical to protect their worshippers as well as religious workers and staff. 
  *	You should not open your premises or place of worship on 2 June 2020, if the safe management plan is not in place.
  *	Religious organisations must submit their Safe Management Plans, including manpower deployment, to MCCY within two weeks of re-opening their place of worship and commencing the permitted activities. 
  * The detailed requirements and format for submitting these plans are available [here](/resources/Resumption-of-Religious-Activities/).
