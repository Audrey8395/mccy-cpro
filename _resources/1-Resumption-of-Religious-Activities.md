### Resumption of More Religious Activities (Phase Two)
In Phase Two, places of worship can gradually resume more religious activities, with the necessary precautions to safeguard public health. Please see MCCYâ€™s [Advisory on Resumption of More Religious Activities in Phase Two](/media/ResumptionofMoreReligiousActivitiesinPhase2.pdf) issued on 18 June 2020  for more detailed guidance.

### Safe Management Plans
Religious organisations (RO) must submit their Safe Management Plans (SMP) at least 3 days before commencing Phase Two activities. This includes ROs who have earlier submitted their SMP in Phase One.

* For ROs who have **NOT** submitted their SMPs in Phase One, click [here](https://www.form.gov.sg/5eeb1acc5a361100119ea96f) to submit the full set of safe management measures for Phase Two activities.

ROs who would like to amend their submitted SMPs may email to [cpro@mccy.gov.sg](mailto:cpro@mccy.gov.sg).
