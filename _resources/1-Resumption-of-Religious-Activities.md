### Resumption of Religious Activities (Phase One) 
All religious organisations must put in place safe management measures before re-opening their places of worship for permitted activities in Phase One. Religious organisations must submit their [Safe Management Plans](#safe-management-plans) to the Ministry of Culture, Community & Youth within two weeks of re-opening their place of worship and commencing the permitted activities. 

All other workplace activities at the religious organisations’ premises must remain suspended. If religious workers or staff need to return to the religious organisations’ premises or place of worship for any other activity than those permitted (i.e. private worship, funeral-related activities, marriage solemnizations, recording/broadcast sessions), religious organisations must apply to the Ministry of Trade & Industry for a [Time-Limited Exemption](https://covid.gobusiness.gov.sg).

#### Time-Limited Exemption
Religious organisations must apply to the Ministry of Trade & Industry for a [Time-Limited Exemption](https://covid.gobusiness.gov.sg) if they need to deploy religious workers or staff on-site for any other activity than those permitted. Religious organisations are not required to inform Ministry of Culture, Community & Youth of these Time-Limited Exemption applications. Time-Limited Exemptions are capped at twice per week for each religious organisation. If additional Time-Limited Exemptions are required, religious organisations can appeal to Ministry of Culture, Community & Youth via [cpro@mccy.gov.sg](mailto:cpro@mccy.gov.sg) and these will be considered on a case-by-case basis.
