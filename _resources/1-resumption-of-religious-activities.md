### Changes to Marriage Solemnizations, Wakes and Funerals 
On 30 July 2020, the Multi-Ministry Taskforce announced that marriage solemnizations can involve up to 50 persons, and funerals and wakes can involve up to 30 persons. Please read Ministry of Health's [Safe Management Measures for Marriage Solemnizations and Receptions](https://go.gov.sg/weddings) and paragraphs 4 to 6 in MCCY's updated [Advisory on Resumption of More Religious Activities in Phase Two](/media/ResumptionofMoreReligiousActivitiesinPhase2updated.pdf). 

ROs which have submitted their Safe Management Plan must submit an acknowledgement [here](https://www.form.gov.sg/5f264fe0878cfc0013f07087) before proceeding with these activities. 

### Resumption of More Religious Activities (Phase Two)
In Phase Two, places of worship can gradually resume more religious activities, with the necessary precautions to safeguard public health. Please see MCCYâ€™s updated [Advisory on Resumption of More Religious Activities in Phase Two](/media/ResumptionofMoreReligiousActivitiesinPhase2updated.pdf) issued on 2 August 2020  for more detailed guidance. Religious Organisations (ROs) must submit their **Safe Management Plans (SMP) for Resumption of More Religious Actvities in Phase Two** at least 3 days before commencing Phase Two activities. This includes ROs which have earlier submitted their SMP in Phase One.

* For ROs which have submitted their SMP in Phase One, click [here](https://www.form.gov.sg/5ee9731b6319c2001142d399) to submit the additional safe management measures for Phase Two activities.

ROs that would like to amend their submitted SMP or have further queries may email to [cpro@mccy.gov.sg](mailto:cpro@mccy.gov.sg).
